# Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
In this module, we begin working with the cleaned dataset from the previous module. The focus is on analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of data, identify the presence of outliers, and determine the correlation between different columns. This helps in gaining insights and preparing the data for more advanced analysis.

## Objectives
- Plot distribution curves and histograms.
- Find the median and outliers of particular columns.
- Compute the Inter Quartile Range (IQR).
- Determine the upper and lower bounds.
- Identify correlations between numerical columns.
- Create a new dataframe with the refined data.
