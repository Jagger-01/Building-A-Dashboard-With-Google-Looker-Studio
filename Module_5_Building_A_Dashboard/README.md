# Module 5: Building A Dashboard

## Overview

In this module, you will create a comprehensive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics or Google Looker Studio. The dashboard will showcase various visualizations, highlighting the distribution of data, relationships between data, composition of data, and comparisons of data.

## Objectives

* Visualize the distribution of data.
* Visualize the relationship between two features.
* Visualize the composition of data.
* Visualize the comparison of data.

## Contents

### Dashboard Creation

* **Description**: What needs to be included in the comprehensive dashboard:
  * **Current Technology Usage Tab**: Visualizations for the top 10 programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks respondents have worked with.
  * **Future Technology Trends Tab**: Visualizations for the top 10 programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks respondents desire to learn next year.
  * **Demographics Tab**: Visualizations for respondent work experience, count by countries, age distribution, and gender classification by education level.

### Data Files

* **m5_survey_data_demographics.csv**
  * Description: Contains demographic information of the respondents.
* **m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv**
  * Description: Contains normalized data of the technologies respondents have worked with and desire to work with.

## Key Points

* Building a dashboard helps in presenting data analysis results in a visually appealing and intuitive manner.
* Techniques include creating visualizations such as bar charts, word clouds, scatter bubble charts, pie charts, filled maps, and line charts.
* Dashboards allow for easy interpretation and drill-down of data, making it accessible for various stakeholders.

## Summary

Module 5 focuses on creating a comprehensive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics or Google Looker Studio. The dashboard includes tabs for current technology usage, future technology trends, and demographics, each with relevant visualizations. The visualizations were created to highlight the distribution of data, relationships between data, composition of data, and comparisons of data. The single notebook provides detailed steps for building the dashboard, ensuring a comprehensive and intuitive presentation of the dataset. The `m5_survey_data_demographics.csv` and `m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv` files are used for all dashboard creation tasks in this module.
