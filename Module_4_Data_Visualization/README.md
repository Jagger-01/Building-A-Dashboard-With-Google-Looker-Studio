# Module 4: Data Visualization

## Overview
In this module, you will showcase your visualization skills using the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 dataset. The visualizations will highlight the distribution of data, relationships between data, the composition of data, and comparisons of data.

## Objectives
- Create a histogram to show the distribution of data.
- Create different plots such as scatter, bubble, or boxplot.
- Create a pie chart, bar chart, and stacked chart to show medians and counts.

### Data Visualization Notebook
- **Notebook**: `04-Data_Visualization.ipynb`
  - Description: This notebook includes all steps for data visualization:
    - **Histogram**: Show the distribution of data.
    - **Scatter Plot**: Visualize the relationship between Age and WorkWeekHrs.
    - **Bubble Plot**: Visualize the relationship between WorkWeekHrs and CodeRevHrs, using Age as the bubble size.
    - **Pie Chart**: Show the top 5 databases that respondents wish to learn next year.
    - **Stacked Chart**: Show the median WorkWeekHrs and CodeRevHrs for the age group 30 to 35.
  - Output: Various visualizations depicting different aspects of the dataset.

## Key Points
- Data visualization helps in understanding data distribution, relationships, composition, and comparison.
- Techniques include creating histograms, scatter plots, bubble plots, pie charts, and stacked charts.
- Visualizations provide insights and make data analysis results easier to understand.

## Summary
Module 4 focuses on creating visualizations to analyze the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 dataset. Various plots such as histograms, scatter plots, bubble plots, pie charts, and stacked charts were used to highlight different aspects of the data. The visualizations were created using SQL for data extraction and matplotlib for plotting. The single notebook provides detailed steps for each visualization process, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
