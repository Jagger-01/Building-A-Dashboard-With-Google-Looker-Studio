# Module 1: Data Collection

## Overview
In this module, we focus on the initial steps of data collection, gathering information from various sources to identify emerging skills and trends in demand. We utilize APIs and web scraping techniques to collect data in different formats. The collected data will then be prepared for further analysis in subsequent modules.

## Objectives
- Work with data in various formats.
- Collect data from multiple sources including job postings, training portals, and surveys.
- Prepare the collected data for analysis.
